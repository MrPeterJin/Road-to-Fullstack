This is a repository to keep track of my progress in the road to learn the knowledge of being a fullstack engineer. I do not have a clear goal of what I want to do in the future, but I do want to learn the knowledge of fullstack. I will keep track of my progress in this repository.

*Note:* This repository is not a tutorial for learning fullstack. It is just a record of my progress. Also, it could be paused or halted at any time due to the high capacity of my academic load.
## Getting Started
I am taking the learn-by-doing approach to learn the knowledge of fullstack. For any segment of knowledge, I will try to build a project from scratch, and learn the knowledge I need to know during the process. For learning materials, I will try to use the official documentation and YouTube videos as much as possible.

## Records as present
The overall roadmap I would take follows the [The Better Dev](https://www.thebetter.dev/) [curriculum](media/FullStackDeveloperRoadmap.pdf). 

- [x] HTML/CSS
- [x] Internet
- [ ] Javascript
- [ ] Linux/Servers
- [ ] Programming
- [ ] Databases
- [ ] APIs
- [ ] Security/DevOps
- [ ] Frontend Frameworks

For the records of each project, please refer to the `README.md` file in each project folder.

## Projects/Materials (in chronological order)
- [My Outfits](./my_outfit/): A learn-by-doing flutter project, aimming at building a outfit managment system of MrPeterJin (or someone else). This is the very first project I build using Flutter framework. However, at this time I have zero knowledge of the front/back end and build this project by copying the code from the [Flutter 3.3 Master Class for Beginners to Advanced - Ticket Booking App Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71AsYo2q_0Y) video. Due to the limitation of the systematic knowledge, I stopped at building the basic framework of the application. (Started on Feb 14, 2023; Completed on May 27, 2023)

- [YouTube Clone](./youtube_clone/): A learn-by-doing html/css project. Following [HTML & CSS Full Course - Beginner to Pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&list=PLEPye7A7EcQZrT3VSBb7jtxnxIfY3yyG6&ab_channel=SuperSimpleDev), this project has fully investigated the basic knowledge of HTML/CSS and clones the homepage of YouTube. (Started on May 27, 2023; Completed on May 28, 2023). After this project, I think I have a (sort of) basic understanding of HTML/CSS and will move on to the next project.

- **Computer Networks and the Internet**: This is a theorem learning process. I go through it through the book [Computer Networking: a Top-Down Approach (8th edition), J.F. Kurose, K.W. Ross, Pearson, 2020.](https://github.com/ece-cohort/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach-7th-Edition). (Started on May 29, 2023; Completed on Jul 17, 2023). After this project, I think I have a basic understanding of the Internet and was amazed about how the Internet works.
