# 30 days of JavaScript coding challenge
This folder is a record of my progress in the [30 day vanilla js coding challenge](https://projectlearn.io/learn/web-development/project/javascript30---30-day-vanilla-js-coding-challenge-170). The challenge is to build 30 things in 30 days with vanilla JavaScript. The challenge is created by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). The following is the detail record of them:

- [JS Drum Kit](./01%20-%20JavaScript%20Drum%20Kit): A web application that plays drum sound when the corresponding key is pressed. (Completed on Jul 17, 2023)
