# Array Cardio Day 1
This is a simple project to integrate JavaScripts that uses array methods to manipulate data.

Key takeaways:
- `filter()` can be used to filter out elements in an array that does not meet the criteria. Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
- `map()` can be used to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- `sort()` can be used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the array. Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort)
- `reduce()` can be used to apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. Source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce)`
