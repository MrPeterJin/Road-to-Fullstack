# JS and CSS Clock
This is a implementation of the second challenge of the [30 day vanilla js coding challenge](https://projectlearn.io/learn/web-development/project/javascript30---30-day-vanilla-js-coding-challenge-170). It is a web application that shows the current time with a clock.

Key takeaways:
- We can use `transform-origin` to change the origin of the transformation.
- `Date()` object can be used to get the current time. We can use `getSeconds()`, `getMinutes()`, and `getHours()` to get the current second, minute, and hour respectively.
- `setInterval()` can be used to run a function repeatedly, with a fixed time delay between each call to that function.
