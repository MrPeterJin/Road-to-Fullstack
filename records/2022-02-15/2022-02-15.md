# Stage 2.1 Report
After the basic framework, I tried to add the components on the homepage (one section of four).

The homepage is dedicated into displaying the highlight information. At present, I consider to display what clothes is urgently needed to be replaced, and recently added clothes.

Still, the frontend work is tedious, today I just completed around 1/3.

## Takeaways
- `Container()` works a lot in setting different components(widgets), it can also be used in a nested way.
- Use `decoration` to make squares with rounded corner.
- Modular design can really break things down!
